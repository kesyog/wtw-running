A CLI tool and Alexa skill that recommends a running outfit for you based on weather conditions
pulled from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) and given user preferences.

Gear data ripped off from a flaky [Runner's World page](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20803133/what-to-wear/)
that tends to spontaneously disappear for periods of time.

There are quite a few similar and likely better tools out there. This is mostly just an excuse to
re-familiarize myself with basic Rust syntax and concepts.

## Usage

### CLI tool

Run the following from the repo root:

```
cargo build --release -p wtw-running-cli
OWM_API_KEY=<API key goes here> target/release/wtwr
```

### Alexa skill

Building the Alexa skill requires targeting x86\_64-unknown-linux-musl. See <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/issues/17>

First install the musl toolchain:

```
sudo apt install musl musl-tools
```

To build the skill, run the following from the repo root:

```
cd skill && ./build.sh
```

This generates a rust.zip file that can be used as a custom runtime for an AWS Lambda function
